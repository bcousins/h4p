<center><h1>What's new in H4P2013?</h1></center>
<p>Host4Post 2013 introduces a number of new features, and some not-so-new featutes into the site. </p>
<p><b><u>Mainsite</u></b><br>
	Thanks to Leyton who has rebuilt the mainsite to fit the visual theme of the community forums.</p>
<p><b><u>Community Forums</u></b><br>
	The Community Forums have been re-coded from scratch to allow us to implement a whole lot of new features:
	<ul>
		<li>We can no longer delete your posts, only hide them</li>
		<li>
	</ul>
</p>
